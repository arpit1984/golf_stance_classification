Approach 1: Simple rule based to detect the head movement among three key events. Based on that, decide if the stance is good or bad.
Approach 2: Add more such rules like spine angle, weight shigt, knee angles and based on that decide if the stance is good or bad.
Approach 3: Trained an autoencoder on the 17 keypoints from the pose estimation and see if there is any obvious pattern. 
Approach 4: Trained a transformer on the 17 keypoints from the pose estimation and see if there is any obvious pattern.
